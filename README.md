Here is a overview of the projects in this repository:

1st project: Positive Voltage Regulator - This represents the first big project that i did in my 3rd year in university. My contribution to this project was the realization of the schematic and the dimensioning of the components such as i had the desired input and output voltage.

2nd project: PC-Components Shop using a Double-Linked list - This project represents the semester project that i realised for the Structures and Data Algorithms course in the 2nd year of the university. My contribution to this project was coming up with the idea of doing a simplified pc-components shop and writing the code.
